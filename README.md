# revolut-listener	

revolut-listener is intended to be a simple app which listens to the notifications the [Revolut](www.revolut.com) app makes when using it to purchase products. The aim of this app is to replace the original functionality offered by Revolut which tracked your spending and notified how much you had spend in a given day, and how much you had left to spend in a given budget period.
