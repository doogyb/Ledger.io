# Ledger.io

Ledger.io is intended to be a simple app which listens to the notifications made by apps such as [Revolut](www.revolut.com) and [Google Pay](www.pay.google.com) when they are used to purchase products. The aim of this app is to
aggregate the output of these apps to track your spending and notify you of how much you spend in a given day
and how much you have left to spend in a given budget period.
