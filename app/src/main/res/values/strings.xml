        Ledger.io is intended to be a simple app which listens to the notifications made by apps
        such as Revolut and Google Pay when they are used to purchase products. The aim of this app
        is to aggregate the output of these apps to track your spending and notify you of how much
        you spend in a given day and how much you have left to spend in a given budget period.
        \n\n
        Please make sure you have the approriate listening permissions turned on, or the app will
        not function correctly and it will not be able to update your budgets accordingly.
        \n\n
        Don\'t hesitate to drop me a mail at
        <a href="mailto:samueldoogan@gmail.com">samueldoogan@gmail.com</a>, to make any suggestions
        or report any bugs.
